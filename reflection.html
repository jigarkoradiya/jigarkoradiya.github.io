		<p>Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean? What did you
			discover in your research?<br>
			• How does responsive design relate to web technologies? How can web pages take
			advantage of it?<br>
			• What techniques, technologies, and patterns did you use in your responsive design?<br>
			• What did you learn about building web apps for different devices?<br>
			</p><br>

		<p>The term responsive design relates to a web design which is responsive. That is, it adjusts itself according to the user environment based on screen size, platorm , orientation etc. 
			In my research, I discovered various advantages of the responsive web design and its features. 
			It allows web developers to make the layouts and css of the website flexible according to the user environment.
			Web pages have lots of advantages from responsiveness of the website. Some of them are: 
		<ul><li>Easier Maintainance</li>
		<li>Simpler website Analytics</li>
		<li>Ensures quality user experience</li>
		<li>Provides on the go access</li></ul>
			
			Everthing that has advantages also have disadvantages. Some of the disadvantages of the responsive web design are:
			<ul><li>It takes longer to download on a small screen.</li>
				<li>Analysis show that when it takes longer to load,a second of delay has 25% loss in visitors for the company.</li>
				<li>Old browsers do not support media query requirements.</li>
				<li>It consumes a lot of time in development.</li></ul> 

			In my design, I used the media query and when the display width is less than 480 pixels, the divisions occupy the full width. So, on a bigger display, I have 4 divisions(mobile phones)
			displayed in one row whereas when the screen is smaller, the website displays one phone in one row like all the e-commerce website apps do. Also, I changed to background color of the body to lightblue when the screen is smaller to indicate the difference.
			I learnt how websites respond to different devices and how I can enhance user experience by these queries on my own website.
			This will help me build my furthur websites better in terms of user experience.
